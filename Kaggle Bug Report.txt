Thank you for your insight and sorry for the late response. The fact is I've tried many different feature combinations aside from the 

final ones shown in this kernel, and PCA always improved both CV and LB score, so I believe PCA do play an import role in my model.

I agree with you on the fiimport edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdOut;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdIn;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.RandomSeq;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdRandom;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.Counter;

public class aa
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int T = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        Counter heads = new Counter("heads");
        Counter tails = new Counter("tails");
        for (int t = 0; t < T; t++)
            if (StdRandom.bernoulli(0.5))
                heads.increment();
            else tails.increment();
        StdOut.println(heads);
        StdOut.println(tails);
        int d = heads.tally() - tails.tally();
        StdOut.println("delta: " + Math.abs(d));

}rst point. If A and B are not correlated, introducing C may cause noisy direction, but only a slight bit. In fact, if you 

have read many other kernels(for example the heatmap in this kernel , https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python) , 

you'll find that most of the old features are NOT totally uncorrlated. So as for your second point, if A and B 

are corrlated, C = A+B, C may capture some pattern that A and B have missed. But there is multicollinearity in it, so we need PCA. 

After doing PCA on A,B,C, the three directions in PCA would all be combinations of A, B and C. So I don't understand why you say "there are indeed only two uncorrelated directions",

since there is no way the first two directions of PCA on ABC are the same as PCA only on AB.



Hello, I recently created a kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/massquantity/all-you-need-is-pca-lb-0-11421-top-4/notebook), but it didn't show up in the competition's "Kernel" section (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/kernels).
 
It's frustrating to see this result, so please check this problem for me, thanks!
